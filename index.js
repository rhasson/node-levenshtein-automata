# This class represents a node in the directed acyclic word graph (DAWG,
# a.k.a.  Minimal Acyclic Finite State Automaton, or MA-FSA).  It has a list
# of edges to other nodes.  It has functions for testing whether it is
# equivalent to another node.  Nodes are equivalent if they have identical
# edges, and each identical edge leads to identical states.
